# bsoyka/infra

This project contains [infrastructure-as-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) (IaC) for my personal projects.
Not every piece of infrastructure I use is listed/controlled here, but I aim to [slowly migrate](https://github.com/users/bsoyka/projects/3) more configurations to this repository over time.
